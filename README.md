# data_flask_api

### Intro
This Flask app will create an API interface for the Data Teams solutions for ["The Bridge" bootcamp final project](https://www.thebridge.tech/blog/reto-de-tripulaciones-the-bridge) (gtT-HIV e-learning platform). This project gives is a cross vertical team (FS, cybersecurity, marketing, UX and data) just under two weeks to develop a MVP for an e-learning platform for the organisation [gTt-HIV](http://www.gtt-vih.org/).

### Our solutions
Our solutions include content recomemdation models, predictive models of user engagement and course completion as well as a live dashboard for admin to get insights about the consumption of content on their e-learning platform. This is implemented here as a python Flask application that allows API communication from the e-leaning platform to the models and dashboard.
